**An easier way to manage the data sources powering your GraphQL server.**

**GrAMPS** (short for **Gr**aphQL **A**pollo **M**icroservice **P**attern **S**erver) is middleware designed for [apollo-server-express](https://git.io/vd1wc) that allows independent data sources — a schema, resolvers, and data access model — to be composed into a single GraphQL schema, while keeping the code within each data source isolated, independently testable, and completely decoupled from the rest of your application.
